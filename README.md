Write a java program to accept the string which will give the synonym of the given word, considering below scenario. 

1. Initialize a static map with the data structure : Map<String, Set<String>>, which holds the given value 
                
GoodMorning 
                GoodMorning 
                Shubhodaya 
                Shubhohday 
                Bonjour 

GoodEvening 
                good Evening 
                Shubha sange 
                susandhya
                Bonsoir

2. use scanner to accept the string from the end user, assuming if the user gives: GoodMorning, show the values associated for the same. 

3. When the user gives GoodBye, which is not there in the Map, ask user if he/she want to add that to the list, when pressed "Y", then ask for the synonym in the loop till user enters a empty string, and the given word and synonym to be updated in the map.
